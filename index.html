            <h1>Personas & Storyboarding</h1>
            <p class="description">
                This page is an analysis of the user experience of interacting with Brown University's mailroom kiosks.
                First, information about user experiences is collected through real interviews and observation
                then, I create storyboards about a user's experience with the kiosks.
            </p>
            <h2>(1) The Interface:</h2>
            <p class="description">
                Hundreds of students interact with this interface every day, 
                and there are often long lines to swipe for mail, so this interface
                needs to be as simple and intuitive as possible.
            </p>

            <h2>(2) Observations & Interviews:</h2>
            <p class="description">
                I observed students using the card scanners in the Brown mailroom, and these my main takeaways.   
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                Students Generally:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Swipe their card multiple times</li>
                <li>Swipe their card in the wrong direction</li>
                <li>Always continue into the mailroom (almost never deciding to not pickup)</li>
                <li>Switch swipe-kiosks if theirs isn't working</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Interview Questions & Answers</h3>

                    <p>
                        How do you determine which direction to swipe your card?

                        <li>

                                Same direction as swiping into a dorm

                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Random direction as long as the magnetic strip is inside the scanner
                            </p>

                                Top-to-bottom for more 'oomph'

                        How do you determine which kiosk to swipe at?

                        <li>

                                Whichever one is closest
                            </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>
                                The inside scanner, since there is less line there

                        Do you ever click the 'Cancel' button?

                        <li>

                                No -- Keep swiping until it works, or move to another kiosk

                            <p>
                                Yes -- Card sometimes gets a partial read (only a few black dots in card textbox) -- need to clear it.

                        Does the information about the number and type of packages you have influence your decision to pickup or cancel?
